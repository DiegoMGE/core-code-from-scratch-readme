## Hot N Cold 🥶
```
Start;
Ask if temperature is in Celsius;
Enter temperature;
    Multiply the temperature times 1.8;
    Save multiplication;
    Sum 32 to the multiplication;
    Save sum;
    Print sum;
If temperature is in Farenheit;
    Print temperature;
End;
```

## Geometry 📐
#### Algorithm to calculate the volume of a pyramid, a cube and a sphere.
```
Start;
Ask if the geometry figure is a Pyramid, Cube or Sphere.
Put words to lowercase;
If figure is pyramid;
    Ask base length and name it as L;
    Ask base width and name it as W;
    Ask height and name it as H;
    Multiply (L*W*H), divide it by 3 and name it as result;
    Print result;
If figure is cube;
    Ask length of one side of cube;
    Name side of cube as 'A';
    Multiply A three times and name it as result;
    Print result;
If figure is sphere;
    Ask the length of the radius;
    The value for volume is {[4*π*(radius)^3] / 3};
    Name the volume as result;
    Print result;
End;
```
